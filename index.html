        everyday you walk around and wonder how the earth was created well the real answer is this<br>
        it start off like this the world has always been where but it was just a rock field land <br>
        but then came natural alkaline water and gave life to everything, becuase of this simple thing <br>
        that everyone takes for granted gave life to everything. trees, oceans, grass even animals <br>
        but the son of alkaline water is VSCS (Visual Studio Code Short-Cuts). the story is pretty simpe<br>
        alkaline water gave life to trees and humans, humans cut trees and make paper, from paper we get<br>
